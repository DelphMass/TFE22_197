"Is there a place for hydrogen in the individual transport sector in Wallonia and Brussels?"

The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain data on the social acceptance of hydrogen in individual transport in Wallonia and Brussels.
This form is taken from the HYACINTH* project and adapted in the framework of my TFE. 
This questionnaire is totally anonymous.

Hydrogen cars use a chemical transformation of H2 (dihydrogen) as a means of propulsion. 
This vehicle is part of the family of fuel cell vehicles, just like electric cars. 
This vehicle does not emit greenhouse gases, however some productions can be polluting.

I run it from January 2022 to April 2022

* HYACINTH was developed in 2017 in order to study the social acceptance of hydrogen in the transition phase in Europe (https://hyacinthproject.eu).
